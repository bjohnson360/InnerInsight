### App Evaluation
- **Category**: Health & Fitness
- **Mobile**: The convenience of having this mobile is the ability to immediately open the app and express your feelings or do breathing exercises and more.
- **Story**: Allows users to be more in touch with their mental health.
- **Market**:There is no well-defined audience of people for this app.
- **Habit**:For people who seriously want to follow their mental health, they could possibly use the app at least once a day.
- **Scope**: I do not think the app will be too chalenging to create.
