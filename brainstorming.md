## Evaluate and Categorize
1. Mental Health Journal/Tracker
    - **Description**: Allows users to journal their thoughts and feelings throughout the day. Users can view motivational quotes, do breathing exercises, track their mood, and ask AI for advice.
    - **Category**: Health & Fitness
    - **Mobile**: The convenience of having this mobile is the ability to immediately open the app and express your feelings or do breathing exercises and more.
    - **Story**: Allows users to be more in touch with their mental health.
    - **Market**:There is no well-defined audience of people for this app.
    - **Habit**:For people who seriously want to follow their mental health, they could possibly use the app at least once a day.
    - **Scope**: I do not think the app will be too chalenging to create.
